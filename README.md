# uogenv (University of Guelph Environment)
This project is my attempt to create a reproducible, deterministic, and accurute development environment that mimics the University of Guelph's linux servers.

## Why?
No matter what course you're in, if it involves programming, you'll probably have to use the linux servers to test and compile. This process can be annoying or slow during development. To allow local compilation without worrying about a different environment, you can use a container that mimics the university's environment.

## How do I use this?
Requirements
- enrollment in a development course at the University of Guelph (I hope, why else do you want it?)
- Docker (any modern version should do)
- shared your drive that contains course work with Docker

Installing
